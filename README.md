# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## First Of all Downloaded Heart Disease Dataset heart.csv in (credits of dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

### Below are the steps for Heart Disesase Prediction Using Machine Learning

1. Loaded heart disease dataset in pandas dataframe
1. Removed outliers using Z score. Usual guideline is to remove anything that has Z score > 3 formula or Z score < -3
1. Converted text columns to numbers using label encoding and one hot encoding
1. Applied scaling
1. Built a classification model using various methods (SVM, logistic regression, random forest) and checked which model gives  the best accuracy
1. Now used PCA to reduce dimensions, retrain model and seen what impact it has on model in terms of accuracy.
